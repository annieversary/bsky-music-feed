* bsky-music-feed

bluesky custom feed implemented following [[https://docs.bsky.app/docs/starter-templates/custom-feeds][this article]].

it contains a few feeds (one for now), which show posts that contain music links

it uses sqlx, so you will need =sqlx-cli=. you will need to copy =.env.example= to =.env=, and fill in the values
